# KidsAppsAndOpportunities
This is a document that contains pointers to our favorite kids apps and opportunities (like summer camps)

—————
# Programing

Our daughter really likes https://www.gethopscotch.com/  . I just downloaded it and handed it to her and she taught herself. It is particularly useful if you are online because then you can see what other apps people are making. 

She also likes http://www.scratchjr.org/ because it allows her to draw and modify the characters. 

Both Scratch and Hopscotch do programing by dragging and dropping code blocks (like Scratch itself https://scratch.mit.edu/ , or the Lego Robot coding language).

Khan Academy <https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-programming> also looks like it has a more advanced set of stuff — but also oriented at drawing, animation, visualization, simulations, and gams.

It looks like there is at least one Maker space in Santiago — it has a 3d printer — http://www.stgomakerspace.com/ . 

# Music

For learning Guitar, we like https://guitarbots.com/ . We are using the free version so far (it limits the lessons to like 10 minutes, which is just about perfect for her because chords can be frustrating for little hands).

# Camps

This is the Rocks and Robots camp that the daughter will go to during the first week of August this year: http://rocksandrobots.com/

Here are some of the programs at Illinois: http://gems.ncsa.illinois.edu/  and http://publish.illinois.edu/womeninengineering/camps/g-a-m-e-s-camp/   This one looks particular interesting: https://engage.illinois.edu/entry/24387 

# Math

For math: My favorite math books are these ones https://www.beastacademy.com/   They are not easy — but pose fulfilling and interesting challenges.

Our favorite math ipad apps are by this group: http://www.dragonboxapp.com/ Even our kindergartener is able to play them.
